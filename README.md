# First Aid Assistant Chatbot

The First Aid Assistant Chatbot is a user-friendly tool designed to provide basic first aid advice for a variety of emergency medical situations. The chatbot utilizes a dataset containing information on injury types, symptoms, and treatment protocols, enabling it to offer relevant guidance on handling common injuries and emergencies. This project is especially useful for quick information on first aid procedures, making it a valuable resource in emergency settings.


## Project Overview

The First Aid Assistant Chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user queries, which can be entered as either text or speech. The chatbot then responds with relevant first aid advice based on a structured dataset of emergency medical scenarios. This project leverages Streamlit for a web-based interface and supports voice-enabled interaction for hands-free use.

## Dataset

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudahmed6/first-aid-intents-dataset), provides comprehensive first aid information:
- **Injury Types**: Examples include cuts, burns, fractures, etc.
- **Symptoms**: Recognizable signs for each injury type.
- **Treatment Protocols**: Steps to administer basic first aid for each type of injury.


The dataset is structured in JSON format, making it easy to process and search for relevant first aid advice.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Users can interact with the chatbot using voice input.
- **Text Input**: Users may also type their questions directly.
- **NLP Processing**: The chatbot uses NLP techniques to identify the most relevant first aid advice based on the user query.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A clean and responsive web app interface, easy to use and accessible.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NLTK**: For text processing and NLP functionalities.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For converting voice input to text.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web app interface.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Provides first aid information in JSON format.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-aid-assistant-chatbot.git
   cd first-aid-assistant-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data** (if not already installed):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)
   nltk.download('punkt_tab')
   nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger', quiet=True)
   nltk.download('wordnet', quiet=True)
   ```

## Usage
